Building
========

In order to build this app, you'll need some node.js and Ruby dependencies.
(It's recommended that you use nvm and rvm, respectively, in order to get the
correct versions.)

To install the node dependencies, navigate to the project directory and run:

    npm install

Then install the Ruby dependencies by running the following command:

    bundle install

You can then build the site by running:

    cake build
